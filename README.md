# Thunderdome #

Thunderdome is a microservice intended to help organize not-so-competitive
gameplay between friends. Its goal is to provide an easy method of
game-agnostic ranking and match-making such that friends can organize impromptu
competitions and events. It is *not* intended to provide serious competitive
rankings.

Thunderdome requires Flask.
